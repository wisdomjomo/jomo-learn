            <h5>All students are required to complete an introductory pre-work one week before the start of class. During pre-work, students will get accustomed to our online learning management system (Canvas), set up their computing environment, and familiarise themselves with the basics of the programming languages that will prepare them for day 1 of the program.
            Our Full Stack Software Engineering Curriculum covers both Back-End and Front-End programming technologies so you can become a full-stack developer. It’s a more extensive course of study than the average school offers but our goal is to teach you more than simply knowing how to code
            To grow as a software engineer, you must be agile and able to learn and adapt, no matter the challenge that you’re given. In our program, you’ll hone communication and collaboration skills, and you’ll become part of the technical community as you build and share a Github portfolio.</h5>
